<!--
The BeanFactory and related interfaces, such as BeanFactoryAware, InitializingBean, DisposableBean, are still present
in Spring for the purpose of backward compatibility with a large number of third-party frameworks that integrate
with Spring.

The BeanFactory is usually preferred where the resources are limited like mobile devices or applet-based applications.
Thus, use an ApplicationContext unless you have a good reason for not doing so.
